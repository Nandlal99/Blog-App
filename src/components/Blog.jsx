        Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework that simplifies the
        development of stand-alone, production-ready applications. Here are some
        key points about Spring Boot: Purpose and Features: Spring Boot combines
        the Spring Framework with embedded servers to create microservices and
        web-based applications. It aims to reduce configuration overhead by
        providing sensible defaults and auto-configuration. Spring Boot
        applications can be ‚Äújust run‚Äù without extensive XML or annotation-based
        settings12. Getting Started: To develop your first Spring Boot
        application, follow these steps: Choose between Maven or Gradle as your
        build system. Create a pom.xml (for Maven) or build.gradle (for Gradle)
        file. Add the necessary dependencies, including the
        spring-boot-starter-parent. Write your application code, including a
        main method that delegates to SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class,
        args)1. Resources for Learning: You can find tutorials and guides on
        Spring Boot from various sources: Spring Boot Tutorials (official
        documentation) GeeksforGeeks Spring Boot Tutorial HowToDoInJava Spring
